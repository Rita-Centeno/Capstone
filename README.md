## Project Description
Our project comes in the sense of a university course - Capstone Project - on our final year of a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at Nova IMS.

Our fictional company, Doc-IT-Right,  is part of the consultancy sector. However, it falls under the health sector, as it intends to provide a solution for the scheduling and management of appointments in different medical specialties of a medical clinic. 

Our project aims to develop an interface that allows the management of a medical office, including a website with information about the company (https://docitrightcp.wixsite.com/doc-it-right) and also a chatbot that will directly interact with the patient, clarifying all of its doubts. In addition, a predictive model was also develop to predict which appointments were more likely to be missed by patients; therefore, empowering the clinics to better manage their schedules (possibly contacting the patient as a reminder of the appointment or confirming if it is still coming).

Our mission is to guarantee that clinics can deliver the best possible service to their patients, in the most effective way possible. In our vision, this software will open up the possibility of increasing the quality of medical service with less or equal resources. By organizing data in an effective manner, doctors and other collaborators can dedicate their time to other more complex and important actions, that will benefit patients in a great way, instead of spending time with routine, basic and repetitive actions that can be performed by this software.

This way, and in a country where there is such a great qualified labour but not so much quantity of it, we aim to get the best out of the available workforce, challenging them into new, more rewarding tasks, and manage them into success and contentment of patients that can, in this way, have better medical care and see their doubts quickly resolved.
