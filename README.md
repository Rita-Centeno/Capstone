## Project Description

Our project comes in the sense of a university course - Capstone Project - on our final year of a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at Nova IMS.

Our fictional company, Doc-IT-Right,  is part of the consultancy sector. However, it falls under the health sector, as it intends to provide a solution for the scheduling and management of appointments in different medical specialties of a medical clinic. 

Our project aims to develop an interface that allows the management of a medical office, including a website with information about the company (https://docitrightcp.wixsite.com/doc-it-right) and also a chatbot that will directly interact with the patient, clarifying all of its doubts. In addition, a predictive model was also developed to predict which appointments were more likely to be missed by patients; therefore, empowering the clinics to better manage their schedules (possibly contacting the patient as a reminder of the appointment or confirming if it is still coming).

Our mission is to guarantee that clinics can deliver the best possible service to their patients, in the most effective way possible. This software will open up the possibility of increasing the quality of medical service with less or equal resources. By effectively organizing data, doctors and other collaborators can dedicate their time to other more complex and important actions, that will benefit patients in a great way, instead of spending time with routine, basic and repetitive actions that can be performed by this software.

This way, and in a country where there is such a great qualified labour but not so much quantity of it, we aim to get the best out of the available workforce, challenging them into new, more rewarding tasks, and manage them into success and contentment of patients that can, in this way, have better medical care and see their doubts quickly resolved.

### - What main technologies were used in the development of this project?
For this project, the main goal was to create an AI-powered Question Answer System which would engage with fictional customers - in our case patients of medical clinics. This would be the primary communication channel of our business - being able to offer services to customers (answering patient's medical specialities, as well as their medication doubts; giving the predictions of which appointments are more likely to be missed to clinics) through a conversational app. 

With this project, we were able to explore more in-depth how to make use of LLM models in different problems, as well as we learned how to create ... (FALTAM AQUI COISAS)

Overall, in the process of development of our project, we used LLM's from OpenAI, Python was the chosen programming language. Additionally, our chatbot was applied, and further on deployed, on a streamlit app. Finally, the company's website was done using WIX.
