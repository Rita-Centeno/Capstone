# GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) Version 3

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. Unlike licenses that restrict your freedom, the AGPL guarantees your freedom to share and change all versions of a program.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to:
- Distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish).
- Receive source code or obtain it if you want it.
- Modify the software or use pieces of it in new free programs.

Developers using our General Public Licenses protect your rights by asserting copyright on the software and offering you this License, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute, and modify the software.

1. **Copyleft**: Any modified version of the software running on a publicly accessible server must make its source code available to the community.
2. **Freedom**: You can distribute, modify, and use the software freely.
3. **Community Cooperation**: Improvements made in alternate versions become available for other developers to incorporate.

1. Include a copy of this license in your repository (as `LICENSE.md`).
2. Add a notice in your code files indicating that your project is licensed under the AGPLv3.
