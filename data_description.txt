In our project we used different 2 different main datasets, which later on originated two others.

For the predictive model: 
- `no_show` dataset: a dataset which was originally on hotel bookings cancellation and it was retrieved from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
The names of the columns were changed to be more compatible with the topic of our project.

- HDI is an additional dataset which contains the values of HDI for each country in the world and whose values were then mapped to the `no_show`dataset.

Additionally, for the chatbot to be able to answer patient's questions about medication, our team collected 36 different patient information leaflets from Infomed (https://extranet.infarmed.pt/INFOMED-fo/) and then joined them in a single PDF.
This PDF was then fed into the model of the chatbot so that it could access the information in this file and collect the needed information to provide an answer to the patient.
The following medicine were included in the pdf:
